Display icons on filer - in info space at bottom. each interpreter needs a geticon which for external ones will read the icon of the external interpreter (could be read at the point the interpreter ini is loaded?)
Allow button repeat - have a counter for each button, after it has been pressed for n milliseconds (reset timer on each loop, and add the current value to the counter for each pressed button for each loop)  (i.e. frames pressed%n ==0), set as a new press, with an initial delay that is a bit longer
Sort files in directory - by type (dir, file) and name

Able to write new uboot image to kernel area of NAND - should perform same checks as when booting to verify the image at least looks reasonable

Able to compile as a uboot kernel, and save the settings to SD instead of NAND for this case

LCD adjustment for F100 as per GPH firmware

Settings:

Can we replace b0 to 17c with nops?
nop is 0xe1a00000 (00 00 a0 e1 in hex)

// need to pad bootloader to 0x80000 bytes so we make sure to erase the complete area. We should then reserve the final 512 bytes for config

Maybe a keypress on boot to override the F100/F200 type?
