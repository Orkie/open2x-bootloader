Settings for autoboot linux from nand, autoboot autoboot.o2x from SD, display icons
Able to write new uboot image to kernel area of NAND - should perform same checks as when booting to verify the image at least looks reasonable - secondary actions needed on the interpreters with Y button, a flash option for kernel uboot image
Change select on boot to ignore settings and reload default

Able to compile as a uboot kernel, and save the settings to SD instead of NAND for this case

LCD adjustment for F100 as per GPH firmware

Settings:
LCD adjustment
autoboot from sd
autoboot from nand

Patch out nand load code from uboot to make loadable uboot binaries

Can we replace b0 to 17c with nops?
nop is 0xe1a00000 (00 00 a0 e1 in hex)

// need to pad bootloader to 0x80000 bytes so we make sure to erase the complete area. We should then reserve the final 512 bytes for config

Maybe a keypress on boot to override the F100/F200 type? What about one to force ignore settings?
