Able to compile as a uboot kernel, and save the settings to SD instead of NAND for this case

LCD adjustment for F100 as per GPH firmware?

Investigate why you can't boot a kernel right after flashing it without rebooting - probably something in NAND driver, need to poll status and check not busy I'd guess
